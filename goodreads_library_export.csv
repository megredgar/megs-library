Not only does this adventure resonate with me, on a “I’m also a wildlife biologist” note, but on one that has made me feel better about being in the field all the time. I have learnt so much from this book and it has made me eager to continue pushing myself to get outside and see as much as I can. It was really fun that she listed all the bird species she would see. Even though this book is set waaaay up north, I was able to see species like the harlequin duck in southern B.C., which made me feel a bit more immersed in the story. All in all, I could go on forever, this book was great and I highly recommend. ",,,1,0
